This folder contains some basic sanity checks for the RISCV Core

- The tests are written in RISCV ASM code and it is translated by the RISCV compiler online.
- The corresponding binary code is dump and loaded into the instruction ram during a test.
- After the test complete, the register value in the register file is compared with the
  golden register value generated by the online RISCV emulator to determine if the test passed or failed.


There are 3 files in each test. For example:

tests/logic_simple/
├── asm                     # ASM code for the tests
├── mem                     # memory dump for instructions ram
└── register_golden         # golden register result
